# Posters
Posters are a way for attendees to present early results, gain feedback from conference attendees, find collaborators on a topic, and/or spark discussion among conference participants. The intent is for these posters is similar to lightning talks in that they provide a venue in support of new ideas and newcomers to the Data Science community.
The poster can be up to 36×48 inches / 91*122 cm.
 
**NOTE**: If work being submitted has been accepted for publication, please share citation.

# Talks
The talks are strictly-timed to 10-minute presentations intended to further expand the Data Science community and spark discussion among participants. The intent is for these talks to provide a venue in support of new ideas and newcomers to our community. Short Talks are a great way to get early feedback on a work in progress, to demo a new tool or technique, and to find potential collaborators at other units/institutions.
Talk presenters may elect to present a poster in conjunction with their talk to provide additional information to curious parties and help foster post-talk discussion.
 
**NOTE**: If work being submitted has been accepted for publication, please share citation.

> _Here are some short talk tips_:
> 1. Describe your problem and convince your audience right away as to why it’s important & what are the current gaps
> 2. What is your cool approach?
> 3. Demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach with one or two clear examples.
> 4. Conclude with why your work matters!
> 5. Preferably use more figures/flowcharts in place of full sentences and lots of text.
