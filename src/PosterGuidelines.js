        <p>Posters are a way for attendees to present early results, gain feedback from conference attendees, find collaborators on a topic, and/or spark discussion among conference participants. The intent is for these posters is similar to lightning talks in that they provide a venue in support of new ideas and newcomers to the Data Science community. The poster can be up to 36×48 inches / 91*122 cm.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE: </b>If work being submitted has been accepted for publication, please share the citation.</p>
        
        <h3>Talks</h3>
        <p>The talks are strictly-timed to 10-minute presentations intended to further expand the Data Science community and spark discussion among participants. The intent is for these talks to provide a venue in support of new ideas and newcomers to our community. Short Talks are a great way to get early feedback on a work in progress, to demo a new tool or technique, and to find potential collaborators at other units/institutions. Talk presenters may elect to present a poster in conjunction with their talk to provide additional information to curious parties and help foster post-talk discussion.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE: </b>If work being submitted has been accepted for publication, please share the citation.</p>
        <p>Here are some short talk tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Describe your problem and convince your audience right away as to why it’s important & what are the current gaps</li>
          <li>What is your cool approach?</li>
          <li>Demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach with one or two clear examples.</li>
          <li>Conclude with why your work matters!</li>
          <li>Preferably use more figures/flowcharts in place of full sentences and lots of text.</li>
        </ul>
